						<p>
							Hello! I am Kersten Odom, an aspiring graphic designer. I have been creating art for as long
							as I remember anything I can get my hands on. I love getting messy with all types of
							mediums, but my emphasis has been on digital art for around four years now.
						</p>

						<p>
							I have spent several years doing graphic design and traditional artwork for several
							different clients. This artwork included large acrylic art pieces for indoor decor, greeting
							card designs that I both designed and printed, formatted and designed invitations, logo
							creations, and personal illustrations. I am experienced in many mediums including drawing,
							acrylic paint, watercolor paint, pastels, lettering, Procreate, Canva, Photoshop, and
							Illustrator.
						</p>

						<p>
							In addition to my passion for art, I enjoy being active and working with children. I have
							been doing karate for over ten years in addition to hitting the gym and anything else I can
							find to be active. I also was a teacherâ€™s aide for ten years where I worked with
							kindergarten - 8th grade students.
